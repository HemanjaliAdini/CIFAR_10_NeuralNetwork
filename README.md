## **Overview**
This project explores the development and evaluation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The model combines advanced neural network layers, customized architecture, and improved training strategies to enhance performance.

---

## **Architecture Design**
The model comprises the following key components:

### **Intermediate Block**
- **Convolutional Layers:** Specialized filters scan the image to detect specific patterns or features such as edges or textures.
- **Fully Connected Layer (FC):** Assigns weights to detected features, determining their significance for the final output.
- **Forward Method:** Combines normalized feature intensities to ensure equal contribution from each feature, producing the final prediction.

### **Output Block**
- **Adaptive Average Pooling:** Averages information across the image for generalized feature extraction.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Processes the summarized data into final predictions for each object category.
- **Forward Method:** Transforms summarized information into a structured numerical format to predict the likely object category.

### **MyClassifier**
- **Basic Setup:** Defines the network's structure and guides image processing.
- **Intermediate Blocks:** Extract key image features through expert processing units.
- **Pooling Layers:** Simplifies intermediate outputs, reducing complexity.
- **Output Block:** Finalizes predictions by combining simplified features.
- **Forward Pass Method:** Drives the data flow through each stage, enabling the network to make informed conclusions.
